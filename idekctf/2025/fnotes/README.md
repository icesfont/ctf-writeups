uncomment the requestrepo code and replace with your own to set the dns records, and point it to a vps which just sleeps on route `/zzz` and lives on port 8080

if inconsistent, slow down the conn pool saturation (requestrepo drops some dns requests)

log in to the user and accept the bot's friend request for flag

this challenge is nerfed -- for unnerfed, add `default-src 'none';`
